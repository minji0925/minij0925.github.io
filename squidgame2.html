        <h1>Squid Game 2 Review</h1>

        <p><i>Last Edited: Jan 10, 2025</i></p>
        <p>Since I haven’t watched the first season of Squid Game, I may not be qualified enough to write a review on 
            its second season. In reality, though, I may be in a relatively unbiased position because I didn’t have 
            high expectations beforehand. Overall impression: I really enjoyed the show! Some parts of it (i.e. the voting scene) 
            felt repetitive, but I can see why certain episodes lagged a bit.</p>

        <p><strong>Spoilers ahead!</strong> There were only 2~3 big twists in season 2, so these spoilers shouldn’t be too bad.</p><br/>

        <h2>The Voting</h2>
        <p>Frankly speaking, this took up at least a third of the running time of season 2. At least, that’s what it felt like. 
            Season 2 felt very political and it was meant to be that way; Squid Game is a mini-society that mirrors real-world politics, 
            and the politics of the game have gotten more intricate with Ki Hoon rejoining the game. With the players now having the chance 
            to vote whether or not to continue the games after each round, things get even more interesting.</p>

        <p>A surprising number of players continuously vote <i>yes</i> because the prize money is not large enough. 
            Their saying yes implies that they strongly believe in surviving the next round, which seems incredulous to me. 
            The Russian Roulette in the first episode freaked me out; if I went through anything of that sort, I would be permanently 
            traumatized and escape no matter the cost. Is the fact that the people who vote yes stay the majority throughout the games 
            somewhat unrealistic? Maybe they are significantly less risk-averse since so many of them are gambling addicts. But this can’t 
            be just it, since every element of the show is meant to be representative of (Korean) society as a whole.</p>

        <p><a href"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BP0mfw6sA8">This Korean architect YouTuber</a> discusses how the voting process in 
            Squid Game 2 symbolizes the pitfalls of public voting and the political division that comes after. Even the people who press 
            the ‘yes’ button have their reasons, and you can’t just call them out; this is not how you do politics. Inevitably, too many 
            players do this after the first two (or three?) rounds of voting, and all hell breaks loose. A very good prediction of the future 
            of Korean politics.</p>

        <h2>Hyun-ju (Player 120, 조현주)</h2>
        <p>Speaking of people who had <i>good reasons</i> to want to continue playing, we have Hyun-ju, a former Special Forces soldier 
            whose life fell apart when she came out as transgender. She needs the money to go to Thailand, finish the gender-affirming 
            surgery, and start a new life. Hyun-ju’s character is handled very gracefully for a kdrama, considering the prejudices people hold 
            against the LGBTQ+ community (perhaps in a more optimistic, positive light than real life).</p>

        <p>The way Geum-ja takes in Hyun-ju’s identity is quite impressive. Geum-ja is a very old woman, and she initially crosses boundaries 
            and makes everyone in the room noticeably uncomfortable when asking Hyun-ju about her trans identity. Over time, however, she sees 
            how compassionate and caring Hyun-ju is and embraces her identity. This left a bit of hope for LGBTQ+ issues in Korea.</p>

        <h2>The Games</h2>
        <p>The two new games in season two were pretty good. Even better, the Six-Legged Pentathlon is a combination of five (or six) very 
            cool games! Gonggi is the best game of all time. I can’t help but appreciate the background music for this one, the utter contrast 
            between the games and the music never ceases to impress me.</p>

        <h2>Young-Il (Player 001, Front Man, 오영일) and Ki Hoon (Player 456)</h2>
        <p>The best twist of this season, and top-tier acting: having the Front Man himself join the game was quite delightful. On the one 
            hand, Ki Hoon got too serious and did nothing but give a bunch of speeches. (that didn’t even work!) On the other hand, Young-Il 
            made the show come alive. His appearance makes viewers wonder how he became the Front Man. He himself seems to have been a 
            participant, and probably a winner. He is much more merciless than anyone else in the show, and all the scenes with Young-Il 
            give you chills.</p>

        <p>My prediction for season 3: Ki Hoon goes through the exact same thing Young-Il went through before becoming the Front Man. Maybe 
            he has a change of heart, maybe he doesn’t but pretends to fake it, and gets nominated as the next Front Man. Maybe he ends the 
            games, maybe he makes them even more brutal. But bottom line: I think Ki Hoon will become the next Front Man.</p>
